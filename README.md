# 🩺 BeatSense: ECG Signal Processing for Arrhythmia Detection Using Python

## 📘 Overview
**BeatSense** is a Python-based system designed to automatically detect arrhythmias through ECG signal processing and machine learning. The project demonstrates how biomedical engineering and computational intelligence can be combined to create an accessible and non-invasive solution for early cardiovascular monitoring.

This repository includes the source code, methodology, and documentation of the BeatSense system.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. To conduct a comprehensive review of ECG signal processing and arrhythmia detection methods.
2. To design and develop an automated ECG signal processing system using Python.
3. To analyze and evaluate the system’s performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
BeatSense processes ECG data through several stages:

1. **ECG Signal Input** – Uses data from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.
2. **Preprocessing** – Removes noise using digital filters (bandpass, notch, etc.).
3. **Feature Extraction** – Detects R-peaks and computes RR intervals.
4. **Classification** – Uses machine learning (SVM, Random Forest, CNN) to classify heartbeats as Normal, Bradycardia, or Tachycardia.
5. **System Output** – Displays the ECG waveform and classification results.

## 📊 Data Source
All ECG data used in this study are from the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database** hosted by [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/). The dataset provides annotated ECG signals representing both normal and arrhythmic rhythms.

---

## 🧾 Ethical Considerations
This study utilizes open-access datasets and does not involve human subjects. The project is strictly for academic and research purposes.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Focused only on detecting **Bradycardia** and **Tachycardia**.
- Not yet validated with live ECG data.
- Intended for educational and research demonstration only.
